# SusSpace-2D

This is a class project with the goal of creating a digital prototype game over the span of five two-week long sprints.
The code you find here is my own personal work on the assignment as the sole programmer of a three person team of students.

SusSpace is a 2D puzzle game where the goal is to use the space junk around your vessel to move around and repair the
broken pieces of your ship in order to make it to your destination. The various space junk you have in reach all have their own
individual strengths in regards to how far they move you, and there are even buff and debuff items that will help and hinder
your progression. The software architecture is designed with Model-View-Controller in mind to keep data, logic, and collision
detection within the scripts organized and code pathways clean and clear.
